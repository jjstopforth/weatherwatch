#Weather Watch
*"Citiizen centered. Scientifically sound"*

> **Word of warning**

>This is a hobby project and as such will not be a dedicated 24/7 development.
I am new to both Django and GitHub so please be patient as I stumble around
trying to tackle this beast. Your support is greatly appreciated! :)

**Aim**

To provide a platform for the citizen to become interested
in their local environment, to help record climate data and ultimately track
climate change through the power of the people!

Users will be encourage to start watching their local environments and store
their data in the cloud.

**Goals/Requirements**

- Fluid & responsive UI
- Beautiful data display (think [Information is
  beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/tag/climate))
- Excellent data analysis tools
- Sound scientific processes/measuring
- User sharing of data (become a local weather guru)
- Collaborative monitoring projects
- Creation of a mindful and dedicated community

**Long term ideas**

- Arduino weather station kits (pre-built/DIY)
- Mobile app for easy recording/viewing
- Detailed and friendly API for external projects to use

**Details**

To be built using Django 1.5.4 and Python 2.7.6 with personalised HTML5 and CSS3.
Extensive use of SVG and JavaScript for yummy graphics and responsiveness.

All information should be stored in the cloud eventually, but local backups
will be kept by the users (much like a GitHub repository). Users will create a
"pro locali" that gives them a front-end site (that they can choose to make
private or public) as well as a "back end" for them to manage, add, and update
their data. If a user is so inclined they can either edit the HTML directly or
use the provided content-management system. A bit like a blog for weather
(sounds lame, but hey it might be a good idea eventually).Social media will be
integrated so that users can prescribe to local weather tweets or get email updates.

 Initially, the project will be targeted towards schools and academic institutions.

**TL;DR**

I am using the concept of developing a social weather monitoring platform to
learn Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.
